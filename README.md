# TheVixEngine

**Vix (The Vix Engine)** is a modern **2D and 3D cross-platform application engine and framework** designed to give developers freedom, flexibility, and efficiency.  

Vix is more than just a library—it's an **entire ecosystem**: everything you need to build 2D and 3D apps without being locked into one platform or editor.  

### Why Vix Stands Out
- **Modern C++**: Clean, efficient, and maintainable code.  
- **No legacy code**: Built from scratch for modern systems.  
- **Cross-editor support**: Works with any IDE or editor—no Visual Studio required.  
- **vcpkg-based dependencies**: Simple dependency management across platforms.  
- **Complete engine program**: Create 2D and 3D apps without manually wiring every component.  
- **Addon system**: Extend Vix with custom plugins and modules without modifying the core.  
- **Future Vix IDE**: A dedicated IDE will make development even smoother.  
- **Platform independence**: Freedom from corporate lock-in—Vix works wherever C++ works.  

## Getting Started
