# TheVixEngine
The Vix Engine or just VIX is a framework and engine for making 2D/3D cross platform apps.

Users are open to use the program to create software of their own but are not allowed to reupload the VIX engine/framework and call it their own. Vix belongs to fenn-dev but is open for contributions.
